\section{Simulations}
In regards of the simulation scenarios we are deliberately neglecting the
critical aspects of the communication between master and slave, therefore
assuming ideal conditions as an istantaneous and loss-less signal trasfer,
without noise.
The table in fig(...) describes the parameters chosen such as inertiae and
cut-off frequencies in addition to the range of values that the virtual
coefficients have undertaken.
% table
As shows the bode diagram in fig(...) different sets of virtual parameters
brings to different slope profile that will be more or less suited to reject the
disturbances.
% bode 
From the upper scheme is clear how the virtual sets will suppress signals at
frequencies higher than $10^3$ Htz with better results than in a rigid
configuration where the aim is to reach full transparency betwwen master and
slave.
This frquancy domain analisys can be validated by the amplitude of the noise
waves shown in fig(...).
????? which is better ???
